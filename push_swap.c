/* 
• You have 2 stacks named a and b.
• At the beginning:
◦ The stack a contains a random number of unique negative and/or positive
integers.
◦ The stack b is empty.
• The goal is to sort the numbers in stack a in ascending order. To achieve this, you
have the following operations at your disposal:
sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a.
Do nothing if there is only one element or none.
sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b.
Do nothing if there is only one element or none.
ss : sa and sb at the same time.
pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a.
Do nothing if b is empty.
pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b.
Do nothing if a is empty.
ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1.
The first element becomes the last one.
rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1.
The first element becomes the last one.
rr : ra and rb at the same time.
rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1.
The last element becomes the first one.
rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1.
The last element becomes the first one.
rrr : rra and rrb at the same time. */
