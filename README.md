# push_swap
This project focuses on sorting data within a stack using a restricted set of operations. The challenge lies in minimizing the number of actions required to achieve a fully sorted stack. To accomplish this, various algorithms are explored and applied, with the goal of selecting the most efficient approach for optimized data sorting.
